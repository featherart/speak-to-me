This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It runs on Node so you need Node/NPM to run it on your machine.
To run it execute npm start in your bash prompt the root of the project, after running npm install or yarn add.
You can see results in http://localhost:3000
To stop it, control + C

## Why does this exist?

For funsies. It's an idea that originally came from thinking about script readers who spend their weekends reading scripts,
and this could be a more fun way to spend your weekend.

## Why is this code so crappy?

It's a prototype and therefore there are no tests and it's got all kinds of stank.

## What is the future of this project?

My hope is to eventually turn it into a more interesting way for kids to relate to books. The vision is eventually to create a tablet that will read to kids in different voices, so kids with dyslexia can understand how awesome books can be.

#Other items to include one day:
- interactive map explorer with lots of D3 maps integrated with location-based information services (Lonely Planet API?)
- ability to upload different books
- native functionality on an Android tablet (cheaper & best platform for Speech Synthesis API)
- chat/sharing tools for kids to comment on texts, share tidbits, drawings, etc.
- use Giphy API to include stickers

Please contact me if you are interested in collaborating!
